# blog-renewal
This repository is renewal version of [old blog repository](https://github.com/3jins/blog.sejin).

Old code of my blog is written when I was finding job, so my ignorance and lack of time have spoiled quality of the code. I decided to regenerate all incomplete things to looking-good ones.


## Features to be added

- [ ] Renewal of 'About' page
- [x] Separation of 'Categories' and 'Tags'
- [ ] Searching
- [ ] more practical and beautiful UI
- [ ] comments & likes for each post
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] replacement of gif files to pure css implentation - e.g. loading screen
- [ ] Easy post upload & update system
- [ ] subscribe
